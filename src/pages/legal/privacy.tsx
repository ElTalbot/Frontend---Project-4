          Specifically, Data may be used by us for the following reasons: <br />
          <br />
          a. For the purpose of booking and providing you 'the user' with the

          <br />→ soft opt-in consent is a specific type of consent which
          applies when you 'the user' have previously engaged with us 'the
          provider' (for example, you contact us to ask us for more details
          about a particular product/service, and we are marketing similar
          products/services). Under "soft opt-in" consent, we 'the provider'
          will take your 'the provider' consent as given unless you opt-out.{" "}
          <br />
          <br />→ for other types of e-marketing, we are required to obtain your
          'the user' explicit consent; that is, you need to take positive and
          affirmative action when consenting by, for example, checking a tick
          box that we'll 'the provider' provide. <br />
          <br />→ if you 'the user' are not satisfied about our 'the provider'
          approach to marketing, you have the right to withdraw consent at any
          time. To find out how to withdraw your consent, see the section headed
