            <br />
            <br />
            Let me start by painting the scene - Itâ€™s{" "}
            <span className="about__bold">March 2020, </span>
            there is a worldwide <span className="about__bold">lockdown</span>,
            a mass <span className="about__bold">shutting of borders</span>, a
            small town in the middle of New South Wales{" "}
            <span className="about__bold">Australia</span>, a deserted, quiet{" "}
            <span className="about__bold">holiday park</span>, housing an
            isolated holiday <span className="about__bold">cabin</span> and at
            this moment in time home to 3 stranded British Tourists with
            currently no way of returning home

          <h2>3 Stranded Tourists</h2>
          <p className="about__caveat">
            I will caveat this by saying I promise I have absolutely no
            intention of downplaying the seriousness of what the past few years
            has been. I just want to paint a true picture of where Owlcore
            originated and why it has grown to be what it is today.
          </p>
          <p>
            Back to the stranded tourists who find themselves in a holiday cabin
            in a pretty spectacular yet rural part of Australia -{" "}
            <span className="about__bold">when / if </span>they would{" "}
            <span className="about__bold">return</span> home to be in at least
            the same country as their loved ones was unknown creating a great
            sense of uncertainty among the 3 tourists. <br />
            <br />
            Thankfully there was an optimistic tourist amongst the group who had
            an idea (and with no other choice but to go with the changing
            guidelines facing them <span className="about__bold">AND</span> with
            simply nothing else to do) this idea seemed like the best thing to
            do at the time.

        <div className="about__section">
          <h2>An optimistic tourist..</h2>

            <span className="about__bold">The idea??</span> To find something

            <br />
            Little did they know the impact this idea would have not only in
            that moment but through every stage of the years that were to
            follow, to this current day and onward.
