                  I will caveat this by saying I promise I have absolutely no
                  intention of downplaying the seriousness of what the past few
                  years has been. I just want to paint a true picture of where
                  Owlcore originated and why it has grown to be what it is
                  today.

                  Back to the stranded tourists who find themselves in a holiday
                  cabin in a pretty spectacular yet rural part of Australia -
                  when / if they would return home to be in at least the same
                  country as their loved ones was unknown creating a great sense
                  of uncertainty among the 3 tourists. Thankfully there was an
                  optimistic tourist amongst the group who had an idea (and with
                  no other choice but to go with the changing guidelines facing
                  them AND with simply nothing else to do) this idea seemed like
                  the best thing to do at the time.
                </p>
                <h2>An optimistic tourist..</h2>
                <h3>The idea?? </h3>
                <p>
                  To find something else to focus on and to make the best of an
                  uncertain situation - weighing up what was on offer it was
                  decided a group circuit was holistically the best idea. Little
                  did they know the impact this idea would have not only in that
                  moment but through every stage of the years that were to
                  follow, to this current day and onward.
